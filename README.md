# csi2999-demo-refresher

This project visits my csi2999 project (or sophomore project) at https://csi-2999-project.onrender.com/ and creates an entry for a campsite reservation. We used supabase's free tier for our development which will pauses access to the database if there is no activity for 7 days. Running this script twice a week prevents the database from pausing and the website displaying an error page.
